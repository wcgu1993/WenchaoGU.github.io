## About Me

Wenchao Gu is a postdoctoral fellow at the TUM School of Computation, Information and Technology at Technische Universität München (TUM), working with Prof. Chunyang Chen. He received his PhD from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in early 2024, under the supervision of Prof. Michael R. Lyu. From July 2021 to January 2022, he interned at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), where he was supervised by Prof. Yanlin Wang. Prior to his time at CUHK, he was a master's student at the Graduate School of Information Sciences at Tohoku University from 2015 to 2017, supervised by Prof. Konyo Masashi. Before his master's degree, he completed his bachelor's degree in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Tohoku University from 2012 to 2015 and earned the qualification for early graduation.

His primary research interests include Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering, particularly large language models, source code understanding and analysis, code generation, and vulnerability detection.
